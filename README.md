## 🎯 Key GitHub Copilot Prompts

### Prompt Template Structure
```typescript
// Example prompt for component generation:
"Using the Figma export at src/data/figmaExport.json, create a [ComponentName] 
component at src/components/[ComponentName]/[ComponentName].tsx

Requirements:
- [Specific functionality]
- [Styling requirements]
- [Interactive features]
- TypeScript interfaces
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features

Extract exact measurements and colors from the Figma export."
```

### Advanced Prompt Examples

#### 1. Product Gallery with Zoom
```
Create a ProductGallery component with image zoom on hover using react-image-magnify, 
thumbnail carousel using react-slick, smooth fade transitions, loading skeleton states, 
and mobile swipe gestures. Match styling from figmaExport.json.
```

#### 2. Real-time Dashboard
```
Generate a real-time dashboard with WebSocket integration, interactive charts using Recharts, 
drag-and-drop widgets with react-grid-layout, and theme switching. Include TypeScript types 
for all data structures.
```

#### 3. Interactive Map
```
Build an interactive map component using Mapbox GL with custom markers, popup cards, 
clustering, and smooth fly-to animations. Include search functionality and responsive design.
```
